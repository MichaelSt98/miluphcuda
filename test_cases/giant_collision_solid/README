Giant Collision of two solids


This is a low resolution test case for miluphCUDA, involving a giant collision of a dry Moon-sized (7.34e+22 kg,
30 mass% iron-core, 70 mass% basalt-mantle) onto a water-rich Mars-sized (6.417e23 kg, 20 mass% iron-core,
55 mass% basalt-mantle, 25 mass% water-ice-shell) body.


The collision velocity is 2 times the mutual escape velocity at the moment of first contact, the
impact angle is 45 deg. This scenario includes solid-body physics, the Tillotson equation of state
and uses ~25k SPH particles (to speed up the simulation)


To run this test case:
  1. compile miluphCUDA with the parameter.h in this directory
  2. unpack 'impact.0000.gz'
  3. adapt the start script 'run.sh' to your system (path to CUDA libs and to miluphCUDA executable) and execute it
  4. once the simulation run is finished (100 output files) check results, e.g., by comparing them
     to the animations 'outcome_mat_types.mp4' and 'outcome_density.mp4', which show the interior structure of the
     colliding bodies (cut into halves) during this collision scenario, or compare to the data given in impact.0100_compare.gz and impact.0100.h5_compare.gz.

The test case should be finished (with the smoothing length given in material.cfg) after 11 minutes
on a GeForce GTX 1080 (with CUDA-10).
