This directory contains example material files for one material each.

To assemble the 'material.cfg' file containing the 'n' materials you need
simply plug them together to end up with a material.cfg file like:


materials = (
    {
        ID = 0
        name = ...
        ...
    },
    {
        ID = 1
        name = ...
        ...
    },
    .
    .
    .
    {
        ID = n-1
        name = ...
        ...
    }
);


Finally take care that correct smoothing lengths ('sml') are set!
